## What is PING?

A ping (Packet Internet or Inter-Network Groper) is a basic Internet program that allows a user to test and verify if a particular destination IP address exists and can accept requests in computer network administration.

The acronym was contrived to match the submariners' term for the sound of a returned sonar pulse.

It sends ICMP packets to destination and verify its existence.

## What is TTL?

Time to live (TTL) refers to the amount of time or “hops” that a packet is set to exist inside a network before being discarded by a router.

## PING and TTL

Output of ping shows TTL of the packets sent to the target. We can determine the OS with TTL.

```bash
ping 192.168.1.8
```

```console
PING 192.168.1.8 (192.168.1.8) 56(84) bytes of data.
64 bytes from 192.168.1.8: icmp_seq=1 ttl=64 time=0.024 ms
64 bytes from 192.168.1.8: icmp_seq=2 ttl=64 time=0.030 ms
64 bytes from 192.168.1.8: icmp_seq=3 ttl=64 time=0.035 ms
64 bytes from 192.168.1.8: icmp_seq=4 ttl=64 time=0.034 ms
##                                     ^
##                             Point of Intrest
```

As we are able to see in above example we are getting a ttl of 64

## What about OS other than Linux?

I have a chart for determining the OS

| OS | TTL |
| --- | --- |
| Unix/Linux | 64 |
| Windows | 128 |
| Solaris/AIX | 254 |

## Impact of Hops


Before I explain this you should know what are hops?

It is the number of intermediate network devices from source to destination. In our case from our machine to target machine.

Hops reduce the TTL for a packet. If we have 3 hops in a network then we will get TTL=61 in case of Linux.

```bash
ping 192.168.1.10
```

```console
PING 192.168.1.10 (192.168.1.10) 56(84) bytes of data.
64 bytes from 192.168.1.8: icmp_seq=1 ttl=58 time=0.024 ms
64 bytes from 192.168.1.8: icmp_seq=2 ttl=58 time=0.030 ms
64 bytes from 192.168.1.8: icmp_seq=3 ttl=58 time=0.035 ms
64 bytes from 192.168.1.8: icmp_seq=4 ttl=58 time=0.034 ms
##                                     ^
##                             Point of Intrest
```

In above example I can estimate number of intermediate devices from my machine to Target machine which is 64 - 58 = 6 and also the OS is Linux/Unix.

## Gimmi a Script

We can use following bash script to determine OS and hops.

```bash
#!/bin/bash

targetIP=$1 ## Get First Argument

## Get TTL value from ping command

ttl="$(ping $targetIP -c 1 | awk '/ttl/ {print $6}' | awk -F = '{print $2}')"

## If Else Condition of above explained Concept

if [[ $ttl -le 64 ]]; then

OS="Linux/Unix"
hops=$((64-$ttl))

elif [[ $ttl -le 128 ]]; then

OS="Windows"
hops=$((128-$ttl))

elif [[ $ttl -le 254 ]]; then

OS="Solaris/AIX"
hops=$((254-$ttl))

else

OS="Undefined"
hops="Undefined"

fi

## Printing Out the result

echo "OS: $OS"
echo "Hops: $hops"
```

Copy the script and paste in a text editor and save as **OsFinder**

Run the script with following commands

```bash
sudo chmod +x OsFinder #Give running permissions
./OsFinder 192.168.1.10 # Replace 192.168.1.10 with your target's IP Address
```

You will get this type of result

```console
OS: Linux/Unix
Hops: 3
```
